The road goes on to the north and south. A large green sign can be seen
off to the side, indicating the Satan City limits.  To the south, the
Western Forest begins, and to the north, the hustle and bustle of Satan
City can be seen and heard; people going to and from work, traffic jams,
police sirens - all part of the daily life of it's citizens.

To the south, a line of mountains seperate the forest to the north and the
desert to the south. Contrast to the lifeless scene south of here, the
forest to the north is quite beutiful.  Miles upon miles of trees, stopping
only to the west at a small bay, leading into the ocean, and far off to the
north, where Satan City is located.

A thin trail of smoke rises up from a charred pit in the middle of this

of the leaves and twigs that would normally make up the forest floor here
are gone, and hard earth covers most of the clearing.

the area and hinder sight too deep into the forest, but unlike on the main
path, the trees here are much closer to the trail, and one could easily
lose it with a wrong turn.

The trail east and west also branches off to the northeast.  The
convergence of so much forest traffic has cleared the area out here a bit,
giving a greater view of the surrounding area. Despite this, your view ends
where it always has - with trees - except far off to the east, where a
large grey rock stands in the middle of the forest.

The path seems to get wider coming from the west, as twigs and leaves

Not so much a trail as a convenient clearing of trees and leaves, this
path goes up a steep hill; probably responsible for the clearing in the
first place. The convenience ends to the northwest, but another clearing
can be seen further up the hill to the northeast, and the brush seperating
it from here would be easy to overcome.

back into the forest, and north into a larger lake. The sight of the clear

On the Water~
The sandy shores of the lake jut into the cliff surrounding it to the
west.  Looking up the cliff, the mouth of a small cave can be seen after
some distance.  The other side of the forest is visible to the east, and
the far north edge of the forest, across the larger lake this one extends
into, is barely visible through the fog.

On the Water~
The woods end to the southwest, where the mountains that once made up
the forest's southern border curve up.  To the west, a cliff shoots up
right at the waters edge, and to the northeast, the rest of the lake
extends out to the other side of the forest.

Light gleaming through the water's surface dances on the sandy lake
floor.  Aside from a few small aquatic plants and the many creatures
inhabiting the murky water, there isn't much to distinguish one part of the
lake floor with any other.

On the Shore~
The stillness of the lake to the east has left small rocks and other
debris mixed in with the sand here, making it quite a bother to walk on. 
The whole thing only worsens to the west, where the small beach meets the
rocky foot of a bare cliff.

Rocky Cliff~
Progressively larger rocks poke out of the sandy beach making the
transition into this barren landscape.  Not a single spot of green can be
seen looking out at the rocks cliffs and mountains to the west. With the
cliff surrounding the area, the only place to go now is up, far to which
the mouth of a cave can be seen.

Cliff Face~
Flying up the side of the cliff, the whole forest area comes into view. 
The lakes to the east and the forest beyond that, and the outskirts of
Satan City north of that are all visible. The view around here isn't quite
as colorful, however.  Bare cliffs and jagged rocks make out much of the
immediate landscape, with the mountains some distance farther west.

From here, the entirety of the Western Forest is visible.  The various
winding paths and trails, as well as all the small forest landmarks
scattered about can be seen. Further up, the cliff continues in it's
featureless fashion, and the jagged rocks down below remind you that it
would not be a good idea to stop flying.

Nearing a cave~
From this high up, the details of the forest are no longer possible to
make out.  The fog covering the larger lake to the northeast becomes quite
apparant from this height, hindering sight of the forest surrounding it, as
well as much of the lake itself. The bare face of the cliff begins to turn
jagged and rocky as many small ledges start to form, and looking further
up, the mouth of a cave can be seen.

Mouth of a Cave~
Almost near the top of the cliff, the cave to the west is about the only
obscurity in this otherwise featureless wasteland.  The cave looks
impenetrably dark, and even the light shining in from the mouth seems to
cut off abruptly. From here, the otherwise unnoticeable layer of fog
blanketing the forest becomes quite apparant, blurring out most of it's
view.

appeared much more majestic before.  But whether it belongs or not, there
is a wall, and it doesn't look like it's moving any time soon.

metal plate built into the floor.

This room has a very cozy feel to it; without windows, the only source

is a leather armchair, and a simple tray standing next to it, on top of
which is a fine pipe.

This whole area has been cleared out; twigs, leaves, brush, and even

axe leans against the side of the house, with freshly chopped wood lining
the wall next to it.  The front porch consists of a set of concrete steps
and a door, which appears to be open. Smoke rises from the stone fireplace
on the side of the house, as well, indicating that someone must be home.

sense of direction again.
