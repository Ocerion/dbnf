This ship belongs to the famed Kilan, creator of worlds.  The control
system is extremely advanced, being that there are no buttons or levers in
which to control the ship.  Rather, there are several glowing crystals and
motion sensor pads in which you only need to draw your finger across to
change the course of the ship.

Mob-Purging Room~
This room is here to purge mobs, since having them purge themselves gives
bug messages, and we don't need a seperate room for this function in each
area.

To use this room, have a mob mpgoto 999, and then say "purge"
