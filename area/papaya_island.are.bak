Papaya Island Docks~
The wooden dock and the entrance to Papaya Island is a very busy, but
well organized place. The wood of the docks is very weathered and in
need of repairs in a few places, thanks to a few errant boats no doubt.
These docks have been in use for a long time, with many hopeful Budokai
fighters rejoicing at their first step onto the isle. The Budokai Stadium
rises up in the distance, its upper rim a harsh juxtaposition to the blue
of the tropical sky. A few sea birds sqwauk at the apparent invasion of
their feeding grounds as ships continually dock and leave.

carnival food wafts over the entire boardwalk.

Before the Stadium~
The full splendor of the stadium rears its beautiful head out of the
boardwalk. The entire stadium is made of some sort of white metal or
stone. The cheers of the crowd spill out over the rim of the stadium,
easily drowning out the now faint cry of the gulls. The boardwalk splits
into two paths that lead directly to the entrance of the stadium. Each
path ends at a ticket booth, the lines stretching back for a short ways.

Before the Stadium~
A sudden plague of filth appears here, with many homeless beggars
making their home near the entrance to the stadium, hoping to collect
a handout from a passing tournament attendee. The air smells of liquor
and cigarette smoke. The ground is covered with cardboard in some places,
torn up turf in others. Graffiti is scrawled all over the white wall
of the stadium, unchecked for a long time.

Entrance to the Papaya Fair~
The smell of mini-donuts and other carnival foods rises to new heights
at the entrance to the fair itself. Flashing lights assault the blue of
the sky as the carnival rides peddle their wares to young children and
thrill-seekers. The ground is very well worn, with two especially visible
paths leading up to the entrance booths that guard the opening to the fair,
their bright colors tempting many a passerby.

This small both consists of a simple counter separating the player
from the straw filled playing section on the game. A small stool sits
a few feet back from the counter, and on it are stacked three bottles
in a pyramid form. The booth is lined with the many prizes that may
be claimed at the gift shop, if enough tokens are traded in of course.
A small sign sits on the counter, reading: 3 Tries, 5 zeni.

There are also a few Papaya Island souvenirs available to trade for.

Vending Machine Tent~
This small tent seems to be used a fair amount by the fair visitors,
each child hoping that their gift of zeni will appease a vending machine
and net them a new toy. The floor is covered in straw and the machines
are quite old. There is a small sign posted on the inside of the tent.

a map grid on the ground, used for carrying away unwanted liquids from
the battlefield. Medics line the outside of the ring, interspersed with

The Center Battleground~
The center of the stadium is the showcase for the most intense battles
of the Budokai tournaments. Many fighters have fell to the ground here,
their strength ebbing. Many more have risen their arms in victory. The
Budokai symbol is prevalent on the ground here, if a little faded. This
is where the Budokai winner is immortalized each time, his name engraved
on the trophy.

the tool he needs with the plethora of shovels and other instruments

radio happily blaring a local station sharing to tabletop with a half

Stairs lead up from the utility area to a door that opens up onto
the stands. These must be used by the janitor to respond quickly to
major spills and problems in the stands themselves. The door is a
grey metal and there is a small handrail lining the wall. The steps
have a worn path of metal up and down.

The Ferris Wheel~
A small line of people are lined up here for the Papaya Ferris Wheel,
either in couples or lonely singles looking for someone to share the
ride with. The Ferris Wheel rises up like a ruler over its flashing
carnival kingdom, its crown well deserved. A plucky, yet romantic,
tune fills the air, seemingly moving in time with the revolutions of
the wheel.

Lifting Off The Ground~
The people on the ground seem a tad bit smaller as the wheel starts
its ascent. The bucket you are in is quite small, and would probably
lend itself well in forcing someone else to sit close. The hustle and
bustle of the carnival continues one below you.

#16057
Further Off The Ground~
The wind has a little more power up at this height, rocking the basket
a little. A young child below is waving up at you like a madman, or just
waving at the wheel itself. Across the way a lucky carnival goer succeeds
at the bottle toppling game and the buzzers are easily heard from your
position in the air.

Almost At The Top~
The basket starts to swing back towards the center of the wheel as
it nears the top of the rotation. The ocean surrounding the island is
fairly visible from here, as are the docks and the boats landing at it.
The music is starting to drown out up this high, interrupted by ooo's and
aah's at the beautiful view

The Zenith~
The arms of the sky fully embrace you at the top of the Ferris Wheel
journey. From here, the ocean around the island becomes a maze of waves
and refracting light. The inside of the stadium is even visible from here,
its white walls enveloping the inner fighting ring. The carnival below
continues on, looking more and more like an ant farm every second.

The Descent~
The basket swings back and forth as the descent begins. The innards of
the wheel are fully revealed to you as you slowly drop, your basket facing
the inner section of the wheel. Many cables and beams hold the wheel together,
most of the time accented by blinking lights.

Halfway Down~
The ants on the ground reveal themselves once again to be human, their

the children below.

Boat pieces and accessories are on display in every visual form and way
conceivable in this shop. Rudders and tack line the walls, while wood
order forms are prevelant. The entire shop is made of strong wood and
is very solid. Many customers have bandanas and eyepatches, seemingly
ignorant of the cliches they provide. A large notice is posted next
to the store's counter.
