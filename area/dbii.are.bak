A quick end.~
The quick and easy way out for now it seems, take a piece of candy on
your way out into the world of DragonBall: Infinity.  It will tide you over
for the time being. If you have changed your mind and want to take the
tutorial, then go NORTH.  This is the last chance you will have to do this.

To leave the area without training do the following:

EAT candy.

Help files!~
The first thing we will learn is about the help files.  Start off with
HELP START.  From there you can see the other basic help files. When in
doubt, try a help file, if you still haven't got an answer then you should
ask the other players useing CHANNELS.  Channels will be discussed in the
next room, for now, back to help files.  Looking at the following list of
files will get you off to a good start, and will also give you a basic feel
for the gameplay.

Channels!~
The use of channels is key to any MUD, or game in general.  It keeps you
in contact with the rest of the player and is a good source of help if you
find yourself stuck.  

To talk to people in the same room as you, use the SAY command.
&R Example:
&C SAY <insert message here>

&YTo talk to people not in the same room, or area there are global 
channels to help with that.  Help Channels gives a list of the channels,
and what each one is used for.

Combat training!~
You will need to learn to defend yourself in this world, and here we
will begin that training.  Use the KILL command to start a fight with an
enemy. Your POWERLEVEL will determine how much of a chance you stand
against your oponent.  Your skills and and stats will also play a big part
in battles to come, once you learn them. 

Off to the east is a training ground for new players, to test there skills in combat. PL : 50

Off to the west, is another training area, but more difficult then the one to the east.  PL : 300

When you have finished combat training, leave UP

&RDO NOT MOVE ONWARD UNTIL YOU HAVE REACHED A POWER LEVEL OF AT LEAST 500.&d

The Icer homeworld is a bleak planet, whose harsh conditions have given
birth to a heartless race of survivors.  Fighting against extinction for
millions of years, the Icers have grown strong both physically and
mentally.  The cruel inhabitants of this world have learned how to control
the strange workings of their alien bodies, to transform into ever stronger
warriors.  Most Icers leave their homeworld as soon as possible, much
happier to conquer a more habitable planet, and make it their own.

So, you're a Saiyan!~
A brutal, primitive people, the Saiya-jins were a race of bandits on
Planet Plant.  Their long-time rivals, the Tsufuru-jin, managed to keep the
physically strong race in check with their technology.  However, the
Saiya-jins took over the planet when Plant had its first full moon in a
very long time.  The planet was renamed Vegeta, and the Saiya-jins adopted
Tsufuru-jin machines for themselves.  Ignorance brought the downfall of
their race when they refused to heed Bardock's warning about Freezer. Their
homeworld was smashed to bits, and only a handful of Saiya-jins survived. 
All members of their race (even halfbreeds) possess the ability to become
an Oozaru, though few reach the level of Super Saiyan.

A race of warriors and healers that hail from Planet Namek, they are best
known for their strange green bodies.  They are able to manipulate their
forms in magnificent ways.  Nameks can stretch their arms to attack enemies
from far away, or even split themselves into two identical fighters.  They
can regenerate severed limbs with ease, and thus heal at an increased rate.
When Nameks recover the ancient knowledge of their brethren, the most powerful
of them become Super Nameks.

Humans are classifed as almost anything originating on the planet Earth.
Usually what would be a strange race to us - like Tien's, Chaozu's, or
the many animal people - is considered to be a Human in the different
series.  Humans are thought to be the most varied because of this, coming
from many different backgrounds and walks of life.  They may not be the
most powerful race at the beginning, but they have many quirks that give
them advantages.

So, you're a Halfbreed!~
Halfbreeds are not a simple mix of just any two races. They are, more
specifically, half Human and half Saiyan. Halfbreeds, for the most part,
live on Earth. Like Saiyans they are born with a monkey tail. Also, like
their Saiyan parents, they have the ability to become a Super Saiyan.
They also transform into giant beasts known as Oozaru, though this
is only possible if their tails are still attached during a full
moon. Rumor has it that halfbreeds are incapable of attaining as high
a level of Super Saiyan. Though this is hard to prove, since so few
attain such unheard-of power.

So, you're an Android!~
Androids are modified humans made by Dr.  Gero.  Due to their creator
they had evil intentions - at least Androids 17 and 18 did.  Another
(Android 16) was good, but he wasn't finished.  In the game this bears no
restriction, with all alignments being available to you.  As opposed to
having Ki energy like other fighters, Androids just have one big power
source inside them.  The downside to this is a lack of Ki dependent moves
such as Final Flash and Instant Transmission.  However, it does mean that
physical attacks pack more punch.

So, you're a Bio-Android!~
Another of Dr. Geros creations.  All bio-androids start out like a blank slate.
All that they have been programmed with are some basic fighting techniques and
the knowledge that to become the perfect being they must use their powerful
tail to absorb their victims.

Bio-androids do not learn like the other races.  They must absorb knowledge
from their victims.  When a bio-android absorbs someone learn what their
victim knew.  This is how a bio-android learns skills and abilities.  They
can learn almost all the skills and abilities that the other races have.
The only things they can't learn are racial transformations and the other
races most powerful attacks.  Most skills and abilities will be learned
by killing other players, how ever the basic skills can be absorbed from
some mobs.


While fighting, bio-androids don't gain very much power level because they
were not created to become stronger by fighting.  At the end of each fight
bio-androids will absorb their victims and gain the power level that wasn't
gotten by combat.  As more and more victims are absorbed the more takes on
the abilities of those races.  Even to the point that they can begin to
gain power level at the same rate as other races.

Bio-androids are one of the best pk races, if not the best.

So, you're a Ghetti~
The race that the villain Garlic Jr.  Is from.  This race never really
played a big role in the world of Dragonball until they turned everyone
into zombies with the Blackwater Mist.  The race is a strange one, they
don't get their power by usual means, they become angry to the point of
insanity in which their bodies grow in size.  They have also been known to
create weapons out of their own flesh, as well as use large amounts of ki
for quick blast attacks.  They definitley have the potential to become one
of the bigger forces in the universe.
