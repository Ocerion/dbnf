The Center of the Universe~
You are standing at the center of the space station.  You can hear many
things that sound like machines running around.  This place looks very clean
and well kept.  You can sense a good force coming from above you, and an
evil force from below.  To the south are sounds of space ships arriving and
departing.

Corridor to the testing labs~
You are walking down a long winding corridor with many sounds of damage
evidenced upon the walls.  You can hear the sounds of fighting coming from
the testing labs just to the north. This place is very poorly maintained,
in stark contrast with the rest of the station.  You get the sense that
most of the stations personell are afraid of what lies ahead.

Testing simulation chamber~
A hologram projector is set up to display selected holograms at the
center of the combat chamber.  Environment modifiers shift the air
molecules around to such a density that it feels just like a real living
being.  The holograms are projected over these dense air molecules, and the
environment bends the dense air to follow the movement of the holograms. 
Security measures have been implemented to allow only one hologram to be
projected at a time. 

&RShould a problem arise with your hologram, just say 'clear room' and the hologram will disappear.&D

Testing simulation chamber~
A hologram projector is set up to display selected holograms at the
center of the combat chamber.  Environment modifiers shift the air
molecules around to such a density that it feels just like a real living
being.  The holograms are projected over these dense air molecules, and the
environment bends the dense air to follow the movement of the holograms. 
Security measures have been implemented to allow only one hologram to be
projected at a time. 

&RShould a problem arise with your hologram, just say 'clear room' and the hologram will disappear.&D

Sparring Arena~
You are in a wide-open room, perfectly set up for sparing.  The floor is
covered in sand, and the walls are covered in energy absorbing plates.  The
plates are there so that the combatants don't destroy the space station
incase they miss their partner with an energy blast.

Inside the Shopping Complex~
There has to be thousands of people inside here.  It's almost imposable
to move because of how crowded it is in here.  Looking over peoples heads,
looking for some place to go there are only three stores that you might be
able to reach. One to the east, another to the south, and also to the west.
