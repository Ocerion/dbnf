This room is one of the few normal looking rooms in this entire temple. 
It is made of stone, and has no bright colors popping out by any means. 
There are three pedestals sitting in the center of the room, each one with
a drastically different appearance than the others.

&CSafe Passage&D~
The floor, as well as the arch that sits on top of it, is made entirely
of a transparent energy.  A quiet hum fills the air, a side-effect of the
powerful energy passage. Small pulses of energy travel along the floor
every once in a while, sending small arcs of electricity across the
passage.

flooding in from any direction.  A loud hum vibrates the walls, but it's
impossible to tell where it's coming from due to the reverberations of the
soundwaves off the metal walls.

This section of the Temple is nothing but a hollowed out hunk of metal
with religious symbols etched into it at regular intervals.  There must
also be some semblance of an air purifier, or there would be no breathable
air.  The glyphs in the hull occasionally glow brightly, then dim back down
and conform to the color of the black metal Temple.

Space Antechamber~
The light that connects this place to Yardrat Temple down on the planet
itself shines halfway through the floor, acting as an anchor.  The
structure itself is made entirely of metal, and has several of the same
symbols and glyphs etched in that were seen in the temple itself.  The hull
of the Space Temple itself is most likely blackened steel, or some type of
metal that is extremely rare.

Instant Transmission Master's Chamber~
Small orbs of light hover aimlessly through the room for some unknown
reason.  The Master of Instant Transmission is nowhere to be seen, leaving
a feeling of emptiness in the chamber.  A small meditation circle sits in
the center of the room, most likely where the Master delved into his own
knowledge to further train his mastery.

Intersection~
The paths split into multiple directions, giving the illusion that this
place is just a giant endless maze.  Faint glows of energy fill the room,
flooding in from any direction.  A loud hum vibrates the walls, but it's
impossible to tell where it's coming from due to the reverberations of the
soundwaves off the metal walls.

&RRed Apprentice's Chamber&D~
Red energy fills the air, flowing into the room from an unknown source. 
The air in here is stale, and static from the energy is giving the room a
slight electric charge.  The chamber itself is made of thick glass,
allowing Yardrat's sun to light the room.

Blue energy fills the air, flowing into the room from an unknown source.
The air in here is stale, and static from the energy is giving the room a
slight electric charge.  The chamber itself is made of thick glass,
allowing Yardrat's sun to light the room.
