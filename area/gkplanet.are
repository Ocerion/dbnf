Grand Kai's Planet~
Once arriving at a very distant planet that seems higher then any other
place in the universe.  Looking around the planet is noticeably smaller
then the earth but still in great size compared to King Kai's planet. Many
warriors are seen all around the planet training intensely, while some are
standing around talking about how to advance and get an audience with this
"Grand Kai". Battlecries are heard from fighters that have been training
for an extended amount of time, since in the Other World..time is of no
concern.  In the distance is a huge palace with a blue car sitting to the
side.

Grand Kai's Planet~
Walking on the paved walkway as fighters fly around, they are in the
middle of training as they pull off some impressive moves.  The ground is
noticably beaten up throughout the years, a few warriors are off in the
distance meditating peacefully under a tree.  The Palace becomes even
larger the closer it comes, King Kai's words echo out as he complains about
how THIS was the car he wanted but wasn't able to get it, and somehow knew
the Grand Kai would have it.

Along the Wall~
Fighters from different quadrants make their way along the wall and all
over the planet.  Each quadrant has their own place on the planet as the
fighters from the norther quadrant are training here. Parts of the wall
have been destroyed which viewed through, fighters from the western
quadrant are noticed as they train and their kai watches over them.

Before Grand Kai's Palace~
The doors to the Palace seem to not have been opened in some time, due
to the fact no one is experienced enough to win an audience with the Grand
Kai himself. Warriors are even sparring on top of the Palace and along the
wall that extends down a good portion of the planet. King Kai continues to
complain about how the Grand Kai's car is a lot better then the one he had.

fighters from the northern quadrant are training here, a few of them walk
up to greet King Kai. He looks at a fighter with golden, curly hair named
Olibu.  King Kai talks about how most superhero's are created in his image,
due to the fact that he was a righteous fighter in his time.

Inside The Palace~
Upon entering the huge Palace doors, is a long and brightly lit
corridor.  The warriors that have proved their worth are able to travel
down this long path to meet with the Grand Kai himself. Pictures of the
Grand Kai hang on the right side as pictures of the other Kai's are aligned
on the left side of the corridor. In the distance there is another door
with a gigantic handles which makes you think about what's behind it.

Along the Palace~
Walking along the Grand Kai's palace takes some time, but is a good way
to get exercise.  His sky, blue car sits here in perfect condition which
also looks like it hasn't been moved in many years. King Kai keeps running
all around it as he continues to drool on himself while staring at the car.
As the warriors keep training, for some reason they stay away from the car
and the Palace as if they are to scared or nervous.

been trained by the Grand Kai are lining the walls. The door seems larger
as a bright light shines from the lock on the door, but there is no key
nearby.

is seen as a giant statue of the Grand Kai, but something seems different

Before the Statue~
About the middle of the statue is here since taken off from the ground. 
The features of the statue seem to stick out as the outfit looks different
from the other Kai's but then somehow similar. The detail to the statue
seems magnificent as if sculpted by the Gods themselve.  The bottom of the
room seems kind of far away to see anything really except for the door at
the back of the room and multiple other exits.

FINALLY the correct sphere has been found which grants access to this
room.  The sign next to the flat object in the room states this as the
Teleporter Room.  Once standing on it, there is a microphone next to a
small computer that is humming.  No other instaments are found in here so
something has to do with the microphone and the flat pad.  Next to the
transporter is a small and worn down sign with words that are hard to make

In a Strange Room~
Slowly the hum of the teleporter fades from memory as there is a huge
empty area with small sphereical objects near the bottom, and some sort of
raised platform. It seems like there are stars around in the room so the
best image that thoes objects could be are mini planets of some sort.

Floating above the Platform~
Hovering here it is discovered that thoes planet like things are about
the size of a house, maybe a few yards bigger.  Straight below is some sort
of World Martial Arts Tournament Ring, but the question is why would it be
here if everyone was dead. Hovering here it is discovered that thoes planet

Straight below is some sort of World Martial Arts Tournament Ring, but the
question is why would it be here if everyone was dead. A roar from below
sounds like there is some sort of Other World Tournament taking place. 
Maybe there are more spots open that can be filled.

Grassy Area~
Upon arriving on the platform, a tall wall is noticed seperating the
crowd from the Other World Martial Arts Tournament Ring. All the kai's
group up as their individual quadrants begin their warm-up exercises for
the tournamet so they can win a chance to be trained by the Grand Kai.

everything seems to be benefitial.  A throne of some sort is sitting in
