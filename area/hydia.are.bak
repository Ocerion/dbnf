&CJulia's Repair-em-cheap!~
This shop seems to be filled to the brim with odd machines.  Everything
from sewing machines to armor repairing machines.  The sound of mechanics
is loud and constant.  The owner of this shop is a small girl no more then
fifteen years old.  Yet she wields her hammer with an assurance that most
older people wouldn't have.

&GHydian Woods~
This section of forest seems to be part of a warzone.  Several trees
seem to have chunks missing out of them, and even more are knocked flat. 
Giant shadows can be seen flying overhead as the sound of crashing trees
rebounds through out the forest.

&GHydian Woods~
This area seems to be strangely quiet and all but free of the smaller
wildlife.  The normal chirping and chittering is gone, replaced with the
sound of the wind only.  The grass seems to be swaying and
possibly.....moving.

&GPath to a Nest~
The trees in this area seem to be pushed towards the east from some
powerful wind.  To the west is a large clearing where a giant nest can be
seen even from here.  Sounds of squacking can be heard carried on the wind.
Random shiney objects litter the path towards the nest, almost marking a
trail.

&GA Huge Nest&D~
This clearing has been made by the trees being blown down from a strong
wind from above.  The trees were then taken and placed into the center in a
giant nest, twice the size of a normal house.  The nest seems to be filled
with different sparkling objects,

large cave to the south.  Several blood trails lead into the cave, and the
sound of cackling can be heard from within.

The pungent smell of death is overpowering upon entering the cave. 
Several small bones are littered around, it is impossible to tell what kind
of animal they belong too.  The sound of cackling can be heard echoing
through out the cave.  A strange slamming sound can be heard from a long
distance away.

&zDeeper in the Cave&D~
The darkness is almost inpenitrable.  The meager light cannot seem to
light even the closest of walls, as if they were made of darkness itself. 
The onyx of the cave can be heard crunching from all around, as though
several things were walking all over it. The smell of death is even
stronger here, as if the source was close.

&zA Large Cavern&D~
This large cavern seems to be man made, the walls are beaten smooth as
if they were hit several times.  The ceiling is uneven and fairly low, as
if something had hit it from below in an attempt to raise it.  This seems
to be the center of the stench as this room is littered with bones of every
shape and size.  One of the skulls seems to shine slightly.

This room seems to be in the center of a large shadow.  A huge throne
lines what should be the northern wall.  In the center of the room is a
huge glowing crystal ball, images of Earth flash on it.  Shadowy figures
dart in and out, bringing different things to the Lord of this area.

ball~
As you look at the crystal ball, pictures of the happenings of Earth
flash by.  A powerful Super Saiyan fights with a vicious Bio-android, while
other warriors watch. Suddenly the picture changes and a strange man with a
huge afro is showing off for television cameras.

throne~
As you look at the throne, you can almost see someone in the shadows it
casts.  As the shadows shift it seems that a pair of eyes appears, and
seems to be looking right at you.
