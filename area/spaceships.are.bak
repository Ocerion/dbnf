&W&uTraining Room&D~
An aged, wise looking man stands in the center of the room.  His gi is
in flawless condition, although his body is not.  Many scars adorn his
face, signs that he knows very well what he is doing in combat.

&RD&zeat&Rh&r Sparring Room&D~
&zThis room is painted to resemble the idea of death.  Black and red
paint is splattered all over the walls, and the sparring ring is as black
as midnight.  A hidden hologram machine generates swiftly-moving shadowy
figures that dart between the beams of light that are lighting this room. 
Every once in a while, a horrified scream can be heard, signifying the evil
that is portrayed in this room.

eager to begin their training.

painted on the walls.  A hidden hologram machine is generating actual
clouds above the sparring ring, as well as the birds and other wild animals
that appear to "live" here.

Space Combat/Ship Maintenance Deck~
A faint scent of oil and grease drifts in from the north and the south,
but is immediately sucked into the ventilation shafts in the corners of the
room.  To the east and west are the ships laser turrets, and to the south
is the engine room. To the north is the Engineer's Lounge.

Engineer's Lounge~
Dozens of tools are neatly hung on the walls of the lounge, and several
bottles of oil and cans of grease are stacked neatly in a corner.  A shower
stands in the corner, surrounded by a tile wall so that a respectable
amount of privacy is attained.

Through the transparisteel window, you can see anything in the immediate
vicinity of the ship.  The laser turrets outside are polished and shined to
perfection, although enough laserfire should dull them up soon enough.

A loud hum echoes throughout the room as the engines send massive
amounts of power throughout the ship.  Every once in a while, a small bolt
of electricity will jump between the engines, but with such raw power being
generated, that effect is to be expected.

can go to relax.  To the south lies a cargo bay, although from here it
appears to be quite empty.  To the north and east are the living quarters.

&rCockpit of the B.M.L. Darkstar&D~
&zThe cockpit isn't really much of a cockpit..  Infact, it seems to seat
several people, or aliens, if you will.  Though the seats are comfortable,
during spaceflight, they actually stiffen up so people at the consoles
won't fall asleep.  Besides that, there's a ton of buttons, levers, and
gizmos that don't seem to be of much importance.

&zThe lounge seems to have alot more color than the rest of the ship. 
Meant for the utmost comfort for those visiting and resting, the couches
surrounding the television look futuristic and comfortable.  A pool table
near the corner offers a bit of entertainment for those uninterested in
television.  Also showcased nearby are several weapons, once used by the
great Gordan Freeman in the Black Mesa incident.

&rEnvironmental Variable Chamber&D~
&zThis chamber seems to be large and circular, leaving no corners.  It's
smooth, and seems to be kept relatively clean.  Some weights sit nearby,
but the main attraction here is the environmental holographics.  Extremely
advanced for its time, the holographic devices can change the surroundings
to match those of any environment, providing it's in the system, of course.
Meaning, you can visit Earth while you're at the other end of the galaxy. 
Even so, this room also acts as a gravity chamber, and mixed with the
hologram environments, is quite a spectacle to behold.

&rHazardous Environment (Sparring&D~
&zHazardous indeed.  This was the environment that the HEV Suit was
created for.  Toxic waste lines the floor, leaving only a few barrels,
large and small crates, to float just above the edge of the waste.  A small
spout nearby dumps out the radioactive fluids into the already toxic soup
beneath you.  An excellent place to spar, but best not in large, unhealthy
doses.  Cancer is bad for you.

&rSurgeon's Quarters&D~
&zThe surgeon's quarters are half living space, half surgery room,
incase something goes amiss..  Like a fighter gets injured.  Seems that the
surgeon's a little crazy, and you're not quite sure you can trust him with
a scalpel.  Eitherways, there's plenty of exits to retreat to, unless you
REALLY need medical attention.

&rHazard Course (Sparring)&D~
&zJust as the name implies, there's alot of 'hazards'.. basically, large
cylinders of concrete, walls, barrels, and crates line the walls and the
middle of the floor, along with other things that might be used as
projectiles.  The walls are covered with the same metal used to absorb
stray blasts, to avoid the ship being destroyed.

&zA similar core to the one used on the high tech spaceships of today,
this one seems to be the top of the line model.  Several aliens wander
around, checking gauges and making sure the fusion process is taken care
of, incase things go horribly wrong.  This room is painted a bright
orange-yellow, except for the floor, with is that same metallic grey.

&rEntry Hatch&D~
&zThe entry hatch isn't anything incredibly special.. just a long ramp
leading down to the ground.  For now, however, it's closed once you're
inside the collosus that is the B.M.L.  Darkstar.  Small screens near every
corner, offers directions to specific parts of the ship.  The ship doesn't
seem to have a whole lot of color, though.
