Frozen Tundra~
 Soft white snow has fallen on the landscape like a giant tissue
covering everything in a gentle blanket. The place seems calm
and eeriely quiet for a place on the infamous planet Furiza land
of the icers. A gleaming almost glass like pyramid can be seen
in all it's shining glory.

 Looming overhead is a massive glassy ice pyramid made out of glazed

tissued in snow and looks extremely slippery though there is a path
between the blocks into the pyramid itself and the ice surrounding it
looks good enough to skate on!

 This ice block marks the edge of this face on the large gleaming
ice pyramid. Falling off here could be extremely hazardous to ones
health as one way down is straight to the ground without many ice
blocks blocking the fall.

Bigger Ice Blocks~
 The ice blocks on the upper half of the pyramid have become thinner
and yet taller so they are much harder to climb infact with the ice
blocks chisselled into a slope it may be impossible to attempt to
climb the pyramid further.

Nearing the Peak~
 The pyramids sharp peak can be seen from his sloping row of ice
blocks, the temprature this far up is absolutely freezing and
the clouds seem to drift ever slowly towards the top of the
pyramid.

Peak~
 Finally the pyramid of ice becomes narrower and narrower until it
reaches it's long sharp peak which reflects the little light the
dark clouds let in. Surrounding the small blocks near the peak is
a strange looking snow that's white and yet doesn't look extremely
pure like the rest falling from the sky.

Frostbitten Tunnel~
 On and on the ki bubbles continue and not an end to the frosty
corridor is in sight. The temprature is still dipping ever so
slightly as the lengthy corridor carries on forward soon it'll
be too cold to walk onward if it continues to get colder.

Isolation~
 A brief turn in the corridor has lead directly into some sort of
void, as far as the eye can see in every direction is nothing but
an emptiness of black. Even a single solitary echo becomes a loud

Fork in the Tunnel~
 The extremely freezing corridor splits several ways here, each is
a similar icy tunnel with it's own set of ki flame bubbles to light
the way. There is no indication to as where each path could lead or

 This corridor of ice is much like the prior corridor, it's made in

creeps down the corridor making the small light of the ki bubbles

Entrance~
 The mist envelopes the door way here and so cloaks the rooms
content from view, though what it visible is the fact the door

Frozen Warriors~
 This room seems to be the source of the mist though here it seems
more like fog because it's mainly crawling along the ground, it's
seeping from large blocks of ice. These blocks of ice seem to be
holding warriors within them, all of these warriors of course are
icerian.

Hall of the Departed~
 The ice blocks for the warriors here are almost like pillars, some
of the warriors were as tall as eight-ten foot and as wide as they
were burly, and so the now departed warriors frozen with ice blocks
big enough to support them. Here are the less decorated warriors,
though each is just as grim as any of the officers.

 A large ice block here resembles those making up the pyramid
this is most likely because the icer held within it is crouched
