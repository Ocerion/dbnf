Copilot's Seat~
The copilot works in junction with the pilot in the flying of the ship. 
The same controls found at the pilots seat can be found here as well. 
However, due to the 'copilot' status of these controls, the pilots seat has
more control over the ship, and more work has to be done in this seat than
in the pilots seat.

Hologram Combat Training Chamber~
A hologram projector is set up to display selected holograms at the
center of the combat chamber.  Environment modifiers shift the air
molecules around to such a density that it feels just like a real living
being.  The holograms are projected over these dense air molecules, and the
environment bends the dense air to follow the movement of the holograms. 
Security measures have been implemented to allow only one hologram to be
projected at a time. 

&RShould a problem arise with your hologram, just say 'clear room' and the hologram will disappear.&D

A blue-purple hue of light glows brightly as the powerful engine as it
sends energy through the ship, powering its systems. The atmosphere of the
engine's dark glow and its lack of any other sources of light gives this
place an appearance of extreme danger.

Naquadria Engine Maintenance Interface~
A massive control interface that links up to the rest of the engine
emits a loud hum, making it nearly impossible to talk in here.  Should any
damage occur to the ship, this is where the repairs would be made.  This is
possible by the trillions of nanotech robots that flow throughout the
ship's electronic systems.  They work through the repairman to make optimal
repairs to the drive, hyperdrive, and weapon systems, as well as the rest
of the ships components.
