pants and a black shirt under the gi, and simple black shoes on his feet. 
His hair is long and braided, ending in a purple bow.  His face is
half-machine, his eyes two glowing red lights, and his ears two cylindrical
protrusions.  Finally, his left hand is missing, replaced by a metal stub.

he sits here, head in hands, at the head of the stronghold, doing all the

This cryptic figure, from it's busted appearance, seems to have come
down from whatever it was that crashed here.  Or maybe it itself crashed
here?  Whatever the case, the android has short black hair, and looks like
a young human adult, perhaps even in the late teens.  It's rather hard to
tell, though, as much of it's artificial skin has been torn off, revealing
a sparking complexity of circuitry.

To operate the slot machines, simply pull the lever.  For the 1k zeni
slot machine, 'pull 1k'.  For 10k, 'pull 10k' etc.  The number indicates
how much zeni the machine takes.  All three machines have the same odds and
winnings.  

Please keep in mind that these machines are old.  If a lever is stuck down,
simply push it back up and continue playing.  Thanks!

North City - A Beachside Road~
This is a long stretch of empty country road, running between the hills
in the south and the ocean to the north.  Lusch green trees line the road,
which has recently been paved, giving it a very dark and smooth look, as
well as permeating the smell of tar throughout the area.

A Beachside Road~
This long stretch of gently curving road hugs the rocky terrain forming
to the south, and offers a pristine view of the northern ocean.  Few trees
can be seen growing here, as the rocky ground of the southern hills and the
sand of the northern beach does little to support plant life in general.

A Short Tunnel~
A tunnel has been constructed here, allowing passage through a massive
sheer cliff jutting into the ocean to the north.  The tunnel is just as
plain as any other one might imagine; curved concrete with flourescent
lights dotting the top of the arch.

The road here is wider than to the west, accomodating the extra traffic
generated by the nearby highway on- and off-ramps.  To the east, the hustle
and bustle of city life can be heard, and the sound of water traffic can be
heard in the distance.

This is just about the busiest intersection in all of North City. 
Tourists and other vehicles coming in from the highway to the west,
industrial shipments to the northern piers, as well as the busy toing and
froing standard to all roads in this tireless city make for quite a noisy
and hectic scene.

of Permesan Stret make for what you would expect an intersection to look

The Boardwalk~
Being located right on the shores of the Northern Ocean, it is no
surprise that North City has an extensive port located within it's borders.
Extending out to the east and west, with a total of four major piers
branching off of it, the boardwalk is truly a tribute to it's great city.

The Boardwalk~
Several small stalls are set up around this part of the boardwalk,
selling mostly food, fishing and boating supplies.  The wooden planks that
make up the boardwalk are old and creaky, the incoming industrial liners
are loud and dirty, and for these reasons tourists generall appreciate the
Northern Ocean from a distance.

The Boardwalk~
The boardwalk is quiet here.  With the brunt of the stalls and shops on
the boardwalk located to the west, only the pier to the north attracts any
people. And even then, the pier contains only private vessels, and few
people own boats to actually sail them, prefering simply to talk about
them, making this the most widely talked about part of the boardwalk while
also being the least traveled.

With the North City Casino just east of this intersection, it only makes
sense that traffic would be a nightmare here.  Gouda Street is busy anway,
and with the bad condition Swiss Street is in, it isn't uncommon for a
drunk to come careening through after hitting some pothole, making this
intersection all the more chaotic.

most held up and repaired.

workers and consumers try to navigate the chaos of the city streets. The
North City Cheese Factory is located just east of this intersection, and a
bit down Gouda to the west, the North City Casino stands.

Northern Ocean are open to the public, and this street continues to the

Provolone Street~
Provolone Street is the largest street on the east side and,
coincidentally, the nearest to the west side.  It is from here that the
impossible mess of sweeping suburban roads and ways extend to all corners
of residential North City.

Intersection of Provolone and Colby~
The constant rhythme of small suburban roads is broken here, with Colby
Street branching off to the east.  Colby is another major street on the
east side, and leads strait to North City High School. Traffic is
pleasantly mild here, with people driving in no particular order and going
to no specific location; quite unlike any west-side counterpart.

Begining of Chevre Court~
Chevre Court is where people who have more money than they know what to
do with spend the money they DO know what to do with.  Huge, well-kept
lawns sweep out in front of every silver mansion, and dozens of shiny,
luxury hovercars are lined up in every mile-long driveway.  Needless to
say, few people are actually seen out enjoying these things, and those that
are greet everyone with the same characteristicly snobby look.

Colby ends here in a smaller circular road, surrounding a small park.  A
few streets branch off of various parts of the road, and at the head of the
street the local High School stands. Other than that, though, this is still
a very quiet and dull corner of the world, as is most of this half of the

North City Casino~
The air is thick with smoke and the smell of cheap beer.  The thick

signs scattered across the establishment, giving the whole place a very
nauseating feel.  And somehow, the place is still packed with avid and
addicted gamblers.

at the entrance seems to be the extent of the 'administrative' part.  From
Dr.  Seuss to Shakespeare, every manner of theme is indiscriminantly
represented on these few shelves; quite and impressive selection for such a

The smell of cheese and the sound of heavy machinery fill the air in
this noisy factory.  Everywhere people are pushing buttons, pulling levers,
moving boxes, or otherwise scurrying about.  To the east, row after row of
huge industrial cheese ovens fill the room, and a wide hallway pans out to
the south leading to other parts of the building.

Grinding Room~
This is possibly the loudest room in the entire factory.  Raw cheese and
other ingredients are constantly being fed to a gargantuan steel monster in
the corner of the room, which seems to be the source of all this noise. 
Once the cheese is fed to this huge grinder, it gets carried off to the
ovens to the north, and everywhere workers are hauling the stuff around.

Cheese Factory~
A few steel picnic tables take up most of the space at the end of the

their lunches. Aside from those tables, though, this area is no different
from any other in the factory; the smell of cheese is heavy in the air, and
the noise generated by the various machines here is only nearly tolerable.

Mixing Room~
This is the final stage in cheese production.  Here, giant vats of
different kinds of cheese and other ingredients are added together and
combined to form new kinds of cheese.  The process seems simple enough, but
the machine hardly seems so; dozens of flashing lights and shiny red
buttons dot it's exterior, and the noises it produces are some of the most
strange one could ever hear.

materials are pumped into the homogenizers huge steel vat, and
then...well...&Usomething&D&g happens, and raw cheese is pumped back out to
other parts of the factory.

This room is a nightmare.  Stacks upon stacks upon boxes of stacks of

impossible to make out enough without the big red 'DENIED' that seems to
plague them all.  Not to mention the only light here seems to be coming
from the various paper fires scattered throughout this legal jungle.

Everything here seems to be made out of some expensive leather. 
Bookshelves line the walls, and a big wooden desk sits in the middle of the
red carpeted floor.  It would all seem very impressive and fancy, indeed,
if not for the terrible state everything seems to be in.  A doughnut box
hangs off of the desk in the middle, and custard stains cover every few
inches of the carpet.  Many books seem to be missing and out of place on
the shelves, with several scattered on the floor or on top of the shelves
themselves.  Finally, an open issue of 'Skin' lies in the middle of the
desk, rather conspicuously 'hidden' within the pages of a much more
official looking document.

The sandy beaches of the Northern Ocean would be a beautiful sight, with
it's sparkling sands and it's gently rolling dunes, and the lusch greenery
behind it all...however, the Blue Bow Army's presence here shatters any

&BThe water below is starting to get rough here, as small waves rise up
and crash back into the salty ocean.  The wind is usually calm, but strong
gusts push past every once in a while.  To the south, the water looks
calmer, and the beach can be seen on the horizon.  The storm seems to be

A Dark Beach~
The sand is much lighter and finer here than on the rest of the island,
which itself is very rocky and devoid of life.  Waves crash on the shore
here, generated by the fury of the storm visible far off to the south. To
the south-east, a shallow rocky land bridge extends into a misty area.

Before the Cave~
The sand is dark and course on the beach here, and the island is very
rocky with few signs of life.  A cave opens into a large hill to the north,
and is oddly well lit.  The beach extends to the east and west, and the
violent ocean to the south causes giant waves to crash onto the beach,
likely caused by the storm looming overhead.

rocky with few signs of life. The rocky hills to the north rise and extend
as far as the eye can see, and the beach extends to the west.  The southern
ocean is violent and wild, huge waves crashing at the rocky shore,
indicating a storm further along.

The entirety of the cave is a dull grey, and very smooth.  The floor has
been evened out by someone, making it quite easy to walk on.  Other than
that, the whole thing is very plain and nothing stands out, save for a sign
attached to one of the walls, and a strange rock jutting out in the middle
of the room.

of the stronghold than out of his own will.  Though he'd rather be out
pillaging or leading his crew, a complex organization like this doesn't run
without a leader, and being the soul living founder, he has filled that
place. The room is furnished with a number of chairs, all arced around that
of Blue Beard, and several small tables and a number of paintings also
furnish the room.

An Open Hallway~
This hallway, like the others, is made entirely of wood.  It connects
the sleeping area to the storage, and ultimately the docks, the heart of
pirate living.  Many people scurry through this area, so it is kept clear
for smooth travel.

A Small Island~
The fog stops dead here, revealing a lush green island scene.  Trees and
shrubs and all sorts of other plants cover the land beyond this small,
beutiful beach.  Quite out of place amidst this greenery is a thin trail of
smoke rising from the southeast.

Amidst Some Wreckage~
The beutiful greenery of the island is further broken here by dozens of
small metal shards and burnt plants dotting the sandy ground.  Further
along, skid marks seem to be headed to the east, and a thin trail of smoke
rises from that direction.

Before a Crater~
The island scene is now totally broken here, as all of the trees have
been blown away or knocked over, and everything seems to have caught fire
and burned up.  Large scraps of metal are scattered around the area, and to
the east, an enormous crater has developed from whatever it was that hit
the island.

Burning Crater~
The ground is totally scarred here, at the center of a huge crater. 
Nothing but dirt exists here; even the scraps of metal before have been
obliterated in the impact.  Several smaller craters have formed on the side
of this massive one, oddly, and seem to have come from different angles.

A Narrow Strait~
A few dark rocks jut up from the ocean, making a small bridge.  Huge
waves crash into the rocks and splatter water everywhere, making the air
very damp.  The natural bridge slowly sinks as it extends along, eventually
into a bizzarre misty void.

The land bridge is totally submerged now under the calmer but still

effort.  Farther along, a thin sandy strait can be made out, and eventually
followed into a deep foggy mist, which seems to begin here.

this thin sandy strait hard to make out.  The now calm ocean waves are
stopped dead by an underwater rift, keeping the sand here mostly in tact,
though it is still bizzarre for such a thing to exist for very long. 
Further along, an impenetrable fog seems to have set in.
