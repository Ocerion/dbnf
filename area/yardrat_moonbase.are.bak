The walkway is one long, shiny tube of chrome-plated metal.  There is
not a single flat surface in sight, except for the platform placed on the
floor in which to walk on. Every few dozen yards, a light is inserted into
the top of the walkway.  Lights are not needed much here, due to the fact
that the reflection of the light off of the shiny chrome gives off more
than enough light to allow one to see where they are going.

The walkway is one long, shiny tube of chrome-plated metal.  There is
not a single flat surface in sight, except for the platform placed on the
floor in which to walk on. Every few dozen yards, a light is inserted into
the top of the walkway.  Lights are not needed much here, due to the fact
that the reflection of the light off of the shiny chrome gives off more
than enough light to allow one to see where they are going.

&WChrome-Plated Walkway&D~
The walkway is one long, shiny tube of chrome-plated metal.  There is
not a single flat surface in sight, except for the platform placed on the
floor in which to walk on. Every few dozen yards, a light is inserted into
the top of the walkway.  Lights are not needed much here, due to the fact
that the reflection of the light off of the shiny chrome gives off more
than enough light to allow one to see where they are going.

&WChrome-Plated Walkway&D~
The walkway is one long, shiny tube of chrome-plated metal.  There is
not a single flat surface in sight, except for the platform placed on the
floor in which to walk on. Every few dozen yards, a light is inserted into
the top of the walkway.  Lights are not needed much here, due to the fact
that the reflection of the light off of the shiny chrome gives off more
than enough light to allow one to see where they are going.

Much in contrast to the outside of the core, it is deathly quiet inside.
Tubing, conduits, and highly advanced machinery all glow with power as the
energy is channeled to what appears to be a massive energy cannon.  Given
the amount of power being channeled into it, it could quite easily destroy
an entire planet, or a galaxy, depending on what was fired upon.
